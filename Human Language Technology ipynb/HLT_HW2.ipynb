Implement a character-level language model based on LSTM.\n","2. Train it on a lyrics dataset.\n","3. Sample previously unseen lyrics from our model.\n","4. Augment our model with an artist information.\n","\n","#### Google colaboratory\n","\n","Before getting started, get familiar with google colaboratory:\n","https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb\n","\n","This is a neat python environment that works in the cloud and does not require you to\n","set up anything on your personal machine\n","(it also has some built-in IDE features that make writing code easier).\n","Moreover, it allows you to copy any existing collaboratory file, alter it and share\n","with other people. In this homework, we will ask you to copy current colaboraty,\n","complete all the tasks and share your colaboratory notebook with us so\n","that we can grade it. We will also use colaboratory for the homework #4 so this\n","homework will prepare you for it.\n","\n","#### Submission\n","\n","Before you start working on this homework do the following steps:\n","\n","1. Press __File > Save a copy in Drive...__ tab. This will allow you to have your own copy and change it.\n","2. Follow all the steps in this collaboratory file and write/change/uncomment code as necessary.\n","3. Do not forget to occasionally press __File > Save__ tab to save your progress.\n","4. After all the changes are done and progress is saved press __Share__ button (top right corner of the page), press __get shareable link__ and make sure you have the option __Anyone with the link can view__ selected.\n","5. Paste the link into your submission pdf file so that we can view it and grade.\n","\n","<center> <h2> Problem statement </h2> </center>\n","\n","In this homework we will train character-level language RNN model on lyrics dataset of most some artists. Having a trained model, we will sample a couple of songs which will be a mixture of different styles of different artists. After that we will update our model to become a conditional character-level RNN, making it possible for us to sample songs conditioned on artist.\n","\n","<center> <h2> Lyrics dataset </h2> </center>\n","\n","For our experiments we will use a subset of [Song Lyrics Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics) which contains good variety of recent artists and more older ones. It is stored as a pandas file and we wrote a python wrapper around it to be able to use it for training purposes.\n","\n","<center> <h2> Character-Level language model </h2> </center>\n","\n","![alt text](http://warmspringwinds.github.io/assets/img/character_level_model.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n","\n","Before choosing a model, let’s have a closer look at our task. Given current letter and all previous letters, we will try to predict the next character. During training we will just take a sequence, and use all its characters except the last one as an input and the same sequence starting from the second character as groundtruth (see the picture above; Source).\n","\n","Our language model is defined on a character level. We will create a dictionary which will contain all English characters plus some special symbols, like period, comma, and end-of-line symbol. Each charecter will be represented as one-hot-encoded tensor. For more information about character-level models and examples, refer to the [the following resource](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch)\n","\n","\n","Having characters, we can now form sequences of characters. What we would actually like to model is $p(current letter|all previous letters)$. At first, the task seems intractable as the number of previous letters is variable and it might become really large in case of long sequences. Turns out Reccurent Neural Netoworks can tackle this problem to a certain extent by using shared weights and fixed size hidden state. This leads us to a next section dedicated to RNNs.\n","\n","<center> <h2> Recurrent Neural Networks </h2> </center>\n","\n","![alt text](http://warmspringwinds.github.io/assets/img/rnn_unfold.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n","\n","Recurrent neural networks are a family of neural networks for processing sequential data. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Because of arbitrary size input sequences, they are concisely depicted as a graph with a cycle (see the picture; Source). But they can be “unfolded” if the size of input sequence is known. They define a non-linear mapping from a current input xt and previous hidden state st−1 to the output ot and current hidden state st. Hidden state size has a predefined size and stores features which are updated on each step and affect the result of mapping.\n","\n","Now align the previous picture of the character-level language model and the unfolded RNN picture to see how we are using the RNN model to learn a character level language model.\n","\n","While the picture depicts the Vanilla RNN, we will use LSTM in our work as it is easier to train usually achieves better results.\n","\n","For a more elaborate introduction to RNNs, we refer reader to [the following resource](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/).\n","\n","<center> <h2> Training unconditional character-level language model </h2> </center>\n","\n","Our first experiment consisted of training of our character-level language model RNN on the whole corpus. We didn’t take into consideration the artist information while training."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Nn83BquKZYC7","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Downloading dataset and
